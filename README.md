## Getting Started

Hello there, you are part of the team LP and we need to create a new responsive homepage. (mobile first)

First, start docker on your computer then enter the following command to run the project:
```bash
~ docker-compose up //it should build the container and up the next server 
```

Take a look at [the design](https://www.figma.com/file/K80by9O5uoETRhLuGCC0Aa/LeParisien---Homepage?type=design&node-id=0%3A1&mode=design&t=MFQHpnc3rqGFTDKO-1). (feel free to set your own unit, it does not matter if it's not pixel perfect)

And you can access to the local environment with your browser to see the result, here : [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)

Next, let's dig into the test : 

1/ Explain me how you will do this ? (write your thoughts and we can discuss about it later)

2/ Let's go for some code. You will find a mock of articles in 'src/data/articles.json', based on this json, you will create the top part of the new page. Some components are already prepared for this (Header/Nav/En-continu...). Feel free to use everything you like (node modules, framework...) to build this page. [^1]


Good luck !!

[^1]: :warning: Don't worry you don't need to build all the page, take 1h and do all you can do !
